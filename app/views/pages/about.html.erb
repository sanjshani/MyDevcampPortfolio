  		<p class="lead">With over a year experience in programming, I realize the typical product creation process between the client and the developer is flawed. All too often developers rarely communicate with clients throughout the development stage, resulting in a final product that fails to reach the goal sought by the customer and the end user.</p>
        <p class="lead">For this reason I decided to utilize a completely different development that focus highly on communication and transparent design pattern. When I take up on a project not only do I work to craft the application according to the clients specifications I give daily updates to ensure that the project is aligning properly with the clientâ€™s goals. The end result is the right product, delivered on time and on budget.</p>
